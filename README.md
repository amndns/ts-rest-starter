## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the `.env` file.

| Route          | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **/api/customers** | Example entity endpoint |

## üöÄ Get Started

This project was created using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Before running any of the `yarn` commands below, make sure you create a `.env` file first. You can simply copy the contents of the `.env.example` into your local `.env` file. Moreover, make sure you also have the proper local resources running before starting the server (e.g. RabbitMQ, Redis, PostgreSQL).

Below is a guide on the common commands you might use all throughout the development process. In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn install`

Installs all package dependencies of the app. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed and configured first.

#### `yarn start`

Starts the server by transpiling all of the `.ts` code to `.js` and then running the `dist/app.js` entrypoint.

#### `yarn start:watch`

Starts the server in watch mode by concurrently transpiling all of the `.ts` code to `.js` and running the `dist/app.js` entrypoint.

#### `yarn lint`

Launches the linter against all of the `.ts` files from the `src/` and `test/` directory. The project specifically uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the linter and code formatter, respectively.

#### `yarn test:unit`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode using Jest. The test is launched against all of the `.ts` files from the `test/` directory.

## üìë Logging

[Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) is being used as the logger. To log HTTP requests, we use the express middleware [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan). You can check a sample usage of the logger utility.

```typescript
import { Logger, WinstonLogger } from '@amndns/service-utils/logger';

@Service()
export class SampleService {
    constructor(
      @Logger(__filename) private log: WinstonLogger,
    ) {}

    ...
```
